ERC20 Balance Checker challenge

This challenge aims at creating and deploying a simple application to check the balance of an Ethereum wallet on some popular ERC20 tokens.

The application shall have a front-end asking for the wallet address and offering a list of the ten most popular ERC20 tokens.

A serverless back-end shall connect to the Ethereum blockchain to provide basic information for the tokens in the list (name, symbol, decimals).

For testing purposes you may use Vitalik's wallet (0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f), he holds many different coins such as DAI, SHIB, UBI and others.
